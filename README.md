# E-Commerce Shopping Cart Application

## Overview

Build an e-commerce shopping cart application using **NextJS** or **SvelteKit**. The application will feature a product listing page showcasing various products with details and an "Add to Cart" functionality. Additionally, a dedicated cart page will allow users to manage items, including quantity adjustments, removal, and total price calculations with potential discounts.

## Technical Specifications

- **Frontend Framework:** ReactJS or Svelte
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS or Plain CSS
- **Data Source:**
  - **Option 1:** Create a local JSON file containing product data (product name, image, price, description, etc.)
  - **Option 2:** Utilize an open-source API to fetch product data dynamically

## Detailed Features

### Product Listing Page

- Display at least 6-10 products using a grid layout.
- Each product card should include:
  - Product image
  - Product name
  - Product price (formatted for currency)
  - "Add to Cart" button

### Add to Cart Functionality

- Clicking the "Add to Cart" button on a product should:
  - Add the chosen product to a user's virtual shopping cart.
  - Update the cart icon or a dedicated counter to reflect the number of added items (optional).
  - Provide visual feedback (e.g., animation) confirming the item's addition.

### Cart Page

    - "Remove Item" button to delete a specific product from the cart.
  - Cart summary section:
    - **Subtotal:** Calculate the total cost of all items in the cart based on their quantity and price.
    - **Discounts (optional):** Implement the ability to apply discounts on the total price. This could involve:
      - Fixed discounts (e.g., "$10 off")
      - Percentage discounts (e.g., "10% off")
    - **Total price (including discounts):** Display the final price the user needs to pay.
